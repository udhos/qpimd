TROUBLESHOOTING

# Check kernel mcast cache
# On Linux:
ip mroute show

! qpimd on last-hop router
! . attached to mcast receiver
! . runnning both PIM-SSM and IGMPv3
!
show ip mroute         (kernel mcast programming is correct?)
show ip pim upstream   (we joined our upstream?)
show ip pim neighbor   (upstream is neighbor?)
show ip pim interface  (pim enabled on interfaces?)
show ip multicast      (multicast enabled at all?)
show ip rib SRC        (unicast route towards source?)

show ip igmp sources   (receiver joined on interface?)
show ip igmp interface (igmp enabled on receiver interface?)

! qpimd on intermmediate routers
! . may be attached to mcast source
! . runnning only PIM-SSM, not IGMPv3
!
show ip mroute         (kernel mcast programming is correct?)
show ip pim upstream   (we joined our upstream?)
show ip pim join       (downstream joined us?)
show ip pim neighbor   (downstream is neighbor?)
show ip pim interface  (pim enabled on interfaces?)
show ip multicast      (multicast enabled at all?)
show ip rib SRC        (unicast route towards source?)
